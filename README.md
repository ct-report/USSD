Contact Tracing - United States - South Dakota

**CARE 19** developed by **ProudCrowd** and used by the States of North Dakota and South Dakota. It's a centralized solution that relies on GPS+WiFi+Mobile location tracking. 

There are some privacy concerns about ID pseudonymization & device location data. The app isn't sending indeed such infos only to app backend, but also to third-parties, since it's still using the free versions of third-party SDK/frameworks - FourSquare and BugFender (more details [HERE](https://blog.jumboprivacy.com/jumbo-privacy-review-north-dakota-s-contact-tracing-app.html) from Jumbo Privacy).
